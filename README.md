#HQSpec

HQSpec is a web based application that improves efficiencies with the the process of Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) requesting inspections for Housing Choice Voucher properties. The PHA may create a property with details from the voucher holder. Then when needed the PHA may submit a request for an inspection and select the type of the inspection needed and the HQS Inspector may log in and view requests.

##Getting Started
----DEPLOYMENT LINK HERE---
At sign in Users are to pick a role of either PHA or Inspector, from there when the User logs in they will be directed to either the PHA or Inspector profile page. The PHA will be able to create new properties from there whereas the Inspector views properties and requests.

##Technologies Used
