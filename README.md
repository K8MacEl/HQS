1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Jimbojones1/Pupstagram-starter-with-login-signup.git` in your code folder
2. Rename the folder to your Project, you can use the `mv` command like `mv Pupstagram-starter-with-login-signup yourprojectname`
3. Delete the `.git` file. When you are in the root of the folder, you can press `ls -a` and you should see a `.git` file, then go ahead and run `rm -rf .git`
